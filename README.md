Arrow Maniac is a 2D-platformer local multiplayer game in a fast-paced environment. In this game you fight with bow and arrow and the goal is to kill enemy players before they kill you. To make the gameplay more fierce we have implemented various types of arrows and unique abilities into the game.

Following are the features we developed in Arrow Maniac:
 - Local-Multiplayer (2 Player Battle with Controller)
 - Player Movement Mechanics (Move, Jump, Dash, Wall Sliding, Wall Jumping, Aiming, Shooting)
 - Normal arrow, Explosive arrow and Ricochet arrrow
 - Time Stop ability and Invisible ability
 - Character Selection Feature (4 different character sprites)
 - Round winning system (Best of 9)
